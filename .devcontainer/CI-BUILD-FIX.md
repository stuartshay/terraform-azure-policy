# DevContainer CI Build Fix

## Problem Summary

The DevContainer build was failing in GitHub Actions (workflow run #18203338190) with the following errors:

### Primary Errors

1. **Docker run command failed** - Container failed to start properly during CI build
2. **Dev container up failed** - Container initialization not completing successfully
3. **No log files found** - Artifact upload couldn't find logs at `/tmp/*.log` or `.devcontainer/*.log`

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Mount Path Problems in GitHub Actions

**Issue**: The `devcontainer.json` included mounts referencing local environment variables that don't exist in GitHub Actions:

```jsonc
"mounts": [
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.azure,target=/home/vscode/.azure,type=bind,consistency=cached",
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.ssh,target=/home/vscode/.ssh-localhost,type=bind,readonly"
]
```

**Problem**: In GitHub Actions runners, these directories (`~/.azure`, `~/.ssh`) may not exist, causing mount failures and preventing the container from starting.

### 2. Setup Script Lacking CI Environment Detection

**Issue**: The `setup.sh` script didn't differentiate between local development and CI environments, causing failures when:

- Installing packages requiring user interaction
- Attempting to copy SSH keys that don't exist
- Running operations that need local file system access

### 3. Missing Error Handling in GitHub Actions Workflow

**Issue**: The workflow didn't prepare the CI environment or handle missing directories gracefully.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Separated CI and Local Configurations

**Changes:**

1. **Modified `devcontainer.json`** (CI-optimized):
   - Removed mounts that depend on host directories
   - Added `onCreateCommand` for better logging
   - Added `initializeCommand` for initialization tracking
   - Set `mounts: []` for clean CI execution

2. **Created `devcontainer.local.json`** (Local development):
   - Includes all original mounts for Azure credentials and SSH keys
   - Full feature set for local development
   - Same tool installations as CI version

3. **Kept `devcontainer.codespaces.json`** (GitHub Codespaces):
   - Unchanged - already optimized for Codespaces environment

### Fix 2: Enhanced Setup Script with CI Detection

**Changes to `setup.sh`:**

```bash
# Added CI environment detection
IS_CI="${CI:-false}"
IS_GITHUB_ACTIONS="${GITHUB_ACTIONS:-false}"

if [ "$IS_CI" = "true" ] || [ "$IS_GITHUB_ACTIONS" = "true" ]; then
    echo "Running in CI environment - adapting setup..."
    export CI_MODE=true
else
    export CI_MODE=false
fi
```

**CI-aware operations:**

- apt-get updates with error tolerance in CI mode
- SSH key setup skipped in CI
- Conditional execution of interactive operations

### Fix 3: Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow

**Added preparation step:**

```yaml
- name: Prepare CI environment
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.azure ~/.ssh
    echo "CI environment prepared"
```

**Improvements:**

- Creates required directories before container build
- Prevents mount-related failures
- Added `push: never` to avoid unnecessary image pushes

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files

1. **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**
   - Removed host-dependent mounts
   - Added initialization commands
   - Optimized for CI/CD

2. **`.devcontainer/setup.sh`**
   - Added CI environment detection
   - Made operations CI-aware
   - Improved error handling

3. **`.github/workflows/devcontainer.yml`**
   - Added environment preparation step
   - Added `push: never` configuration

4. **`.devcontainer/README.md`**
   - Added section explaining different configurations
   - Added usage instructions

### New Files

1. **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.local.json`**
   - Local development configuration
   - Includes all mounts for credentials and SSH
   - For VS Code local usage

2. **`.devcontainer/CI-BUILD-FIX.md`**
   - This document

## Testing Recommendations

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test the CI configuration locally
devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --config .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

# Test the local configuration
devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --config .devcontainer/devcontainer.local.json
```

### CI Testing

The workflow will automatically test on:

- Push to `develop` or `master` with devcontainer changes
- Pull requests targeting `develop` or `master` with devcontainer changes
- Manual workflow dispatch

## Migration Guide

### For Local Development

#### Option 1: Keep using the CI config (no mounts)

- No action needed
- Azure credentials and SSH keys won't be mounted
- You'll need to run `az login` each time

#### Option 2: Switch to local config (with mounts)

```bash
# Backup current config
mv .devcontainer/devcontainer.json .devcontainer/devcontainer.ci.json

# Use local config
mv .devcontainer/devcontainer.local.json .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

# Rebuild container
# Command Palette: "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
```

### For CI/CD

No action needed - the workflow now uses the optimized `devcontainer.json` configuration.

### For GitHub Codespaces

Continue using `devcontainer.codespaces.json` - it's already optimized.

## Expected Outcomes

After these fixes:

✅ **CI builds should succeed** - No mount-related failures
✅ **Container starts properly** - All dependencies install correctly
✅ **Tests run successfully** - All validation checks pass
✅ **Local development unaffected** - Option to use mounts via local config
✅ **Better error messages** - CI mode provides clearer feedback

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Push changes to branch
2. ✅ Verify GitHub Actions workflow succeeds
3. ✅ Check all three jobs pass:
   - Test Devcontainer Build
   - Validate Setup Scripts
   - Verify Documentation
4. ✅ Test local development with both configs
5. ✅ Verify Codespaces still works

## Additional Notes

### Why Not Use Conditional Mounts?

While DevContainer features support conditions, mount conditionals based on environment variables aren't well-supported across all environments. The approach of separate configuration files provides:

- **Clarity**: Clear separation of CI vs local configs
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify each environment independently
- **Reliability**: No runtime conditional logic that could fail
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between configs for testing

### Future Enhancements

Consider:

- Adding a devcontainer selection script
- Creating a VS Code task to switch configs
- Adding more environment-specific optimizations
- Implementing container health checks
